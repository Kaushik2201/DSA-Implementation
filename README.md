# DSA-Implementation

## Hello Future Engineers :)

You all know the importance is Data Structures and Algorithms for your future, but not sure where they are used in real life so this track is for people like you all.

1. This track's primary goal is to inform you guys of the actual situations in which so-called DSA is employed.
2. This track will also make it easier for you to understand the main data structures, which will aid you in your upcoming classes.
3. After viewing DSA, don't flee. Every question is carefully considered to ensure that it is easy as well as challenging.
4. Each question has a link to ```Notes``` and ```Resources```, which will help you answer the questions more quickly and, more importantly, grasp the underlying ideas.
5. So embrace this challenge to the fullest and pick up new skills.


## Please read rules and follow them carefully

**1. It is important that the name of the repository for this challange must be in this format ```TeamName_DSA_Implementation_BTSC```**

**2. You can code in any programming language of your choice**

**3. After Coding the solution which passes all the test cases make a folder whose name will be the mentioned in the readme of that particular question and place all the code files in that folder only**

**4. Do not create more than one Repo it should be just 1 Repo with 3 different folders and each folder containing the code for each question**

**5. There are 2 questions in each ```markdown``` file out of which you have to solve any one for each file**

**6. Your code will be tested on how clean and understandable to others it is**

**7. Refrain from using CHAT-GPT, COPILOT, GEMINI or any other AI TOOLS** 

**8. Each Question has different points alloted, because of its difficulty level**


**Lasly donot be afraid of these questions take them as new learnings and submit the Repository even if questions are not solved completely as something is better than nothing and there will be marking for each and every function**





***ALL THE BEST FUTURE ENGINEERS !!!!***
